1. Connect
First connect BeagleBone to my computer and go with the steps on piazza to set up the BeagleBone.
These steps including:
Install the drivers
ssh debian@192.168.8.1 with password "temppwd"
Connect to wifi
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install xauth
sudo apt-get install xvfb
sudo apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb

2. Set up
I set up a new hostname for my BeagleBone:
hostname vincentl

Then I set up a new non-root user and change its password:
useradd vincentl
passwd vincentl
Then type "password" twice as the password.

Therefore a new user "vincentl" with password "password" is added on the BeagleBone.
Lastly, I set up a home directory for the new user:
mkdir /home/vincentl

3. Get IP address
Use the "ifconfig" command to get the IP address of my BeagleBone, which shows at "inet addr" of wlan0 that my IP address is:
192.168.1.23
Similarly, I get my partner Ann's IP address, which is:
172.20.10.5

4. Log in set up
To log in without password, I first create a key pair:
ssh key-gen

Then I make a ".shh" directory to allow my parter log in:
cd /home/vincentl
mkdir .ssh

And change ownership and permission on .ssh directory:
chown -R vincentl .ssh
chmod 700 .ssh

5. Log in
I first test the reachability of the host:
ping 
Then I copy the generated key on to my partner 's host:
ssh-copy-id -i vincentl@192.168.1.23
And type yes for the question and type my password "password".
Therefore I successfully log in the host.

6. Test logging in
Get the environment variables for connection with the following command:
eval `ssh-agent`
Then copy they key, and type in the public key:
ssh-add
Finally, ssh onto the host:
ssh vincentl@192.168.1.23
And it doesn't require me to type in the password to log in.

7. Test with applications
Log onto my partner 's BeagleBone through my host
ssh -X myusername@172.20.10.5
Then sequentially type the following commands:
xterm
gedit
firefox

They all work successfully with windows popping up.
